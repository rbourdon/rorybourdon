This is my personal portfolio website, intended to showcase my design and development skills as well as allow me to display and discuss the various projects I've worked on. I designed this site in Adobe Illustrator and built it in Visual Studio Code using Next.js.

&nbsp;

### :wrench: Technologies

**[Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)** - React, but *better:tm:*

**[Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion)** - Slick animation and layout transitions

**[Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)** - Modular CSS in JS

**[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)** - Clean and simple API queries

&nbsp;

### :electric_plug: Services
**[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** - The best Next.js integration, analytics, a generous hobby plan, and UX that sparks joy

**[Hygraph (formerly GraphCMS)](https://hygraph.com/)** - Nice headless CMS with a GraphQL API, generous free tier and great tools

There are a few MDX components you can use in the project page content field. Here's how the begining of the VRBG Project MDX looks, for example.

```
<Title>Multiplayer VR Battle Royale Prototype </Title>
<Post>
<PostVideo src={images[0].url}><Caption>A fly-through of part of the map I built. I used a mix of DEM data, procedural generation and hand sculpting.</Caption></PostVideo>
<Content>This is a prototype virtual reality multiplayer battle royale game built for the HTC Vive using Unreal Engine 4. I built this prototype entirely with blueprints and no marketplace assets. I modeled, rigged and textured everything in Blender and used blend shapes in UE4 to do animations. </Content>
<Content>Because I built so much for this project, I'll break it down into sections, starting with the map.</Content>

<Title>The Map</Title>
<Post>
<PostImage src={images[1].url} quality={100} width={1081} height={1081}><Caption>DEM data used to create a heightmap for the landscape.</Caption></PostImage>
<Content>I started with some DEM data of an area that looked interesting in Maine, approximately 1.8kmÂ² in size. This was then modified in Photoshop to exaggerate and stylize some of the features. I brought the final image into UE4 and used it as a heightmap with the landscape system to generate the terrain.</Content>
